        "summary": "Fix the Valentine Opening Screen “No” button movement so the button’s rendered bounding box always remains completely within the visible viewport (no partial off-screen placement). Random repositioning must be strictly constrained within the viewport boundaries and must properly account for the button’s current width/height and dynamic viewport changes (resize/orientation/zoom/mobile browser UI). The button must remain fully visible and clickable at all times while still moving playfully and randomly within the safe area. Keep everything else unchanged.",
