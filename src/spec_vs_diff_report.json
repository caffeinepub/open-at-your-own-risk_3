  "summary": "The diff implements the overall single-page Valentine flow (Opening → fade-to-black + pink fireworks → Final screen), including responsive layout, pink theme, evasive “No” button, floating hearts, GIF, and optional music control. However, a couple of spec text/title details appear missing or mismatched, and several unrequested/non-goal features were added (Internet Identity/auth scaffolding and a backend canister stub).",
