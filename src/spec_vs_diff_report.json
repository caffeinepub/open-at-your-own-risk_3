  "summary": "The diff implements viewport- and button-dimension-aware clamping for the Valentine Opening Screen “No” button in `NoButton.tsx`, using `getBoundingClientRect()` for current button size and `visualViewport`/window fallbacks for viewport size, plus post-render verification and (truncated but indicated) viewport-change handling. No clearly missing REQ-1 items are identifiable from the provided diff summary; no clearly unrequested UI/behavior features are evidenced beyond the intended fix.",
